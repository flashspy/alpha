# Check server status
python3 bin/alpha status --port 9000

# Connect for chat (WebSocket client)
./scripts/start_client.sh --server ws://localhost:9000/api/v1/ws/chat

# Or use the alpha command (if installed in PATH)
export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/bin"
alpha chat --port 9000

# Stop server
python3 bin/alpha stop

# Disconnect anytime - server keeps running!
# Reconnect later - conversation history preserved!
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Which AI provider should I choose?**
A: For most users, DeepSeek is recommended due to its excellent cost-effectiveness and Chinese language support. Use Claude for complex coding tasks.

**Q: Can I use Alpha without an internet connection?**
A: Alpha requires an internet connection to communicate with AI providers. Some tools (like Calculator and DateTime) work offline.

**Q: Is my data private?**
A: All conversations are stored locally in `data/alpha.db`. API providers (DeepSeek, Anthropic, OpenAI) process your messages according to their privacy policies.

**Q: Can I schedule recurring tasks?**
A: Yes! Use cron expressions or interval-based scheduling. Example: "Schedule this task to run every Monday at 10am"

**Q: How much does it cost to use Alpha?**
A: Alpha itself is free. You only pay for API usage:
- DeepSeek: ~$0.42 per million tokens
- Claude: ~$18 per million tokens
- GPT-4: ~$20 per million tokens
