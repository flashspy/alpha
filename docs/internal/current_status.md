## Active Tasks

### Primary Task
- **Task**: Autonomous Development - Feature Gap Analysis & New Development
- **Started**: 2026-01-31 23:00
- **Current Phase**: Step 4 - Autonomous New Feature Development
- **Status**: Core features verified (99%+), analyzing next priorities
- **Summary**:
  - ✅ Fixed test_resource_limit_time timing issue
  - ✅ Documented network-dependent test issues
  - ✅ Verified core functionality (78/78 critical tests pass)
  - ✅ Analyzed REQ-6.2.5: keep deferred (needs design)
  - 🔍 Now: Autonomous feature gap analysis per Alpha positioning
- **Next Action**: Identify and implement next critical features

### Parallel Tasks
- None (Phase 6.1 completed sequentially)
