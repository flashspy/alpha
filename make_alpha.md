# Alpha: Personal Super AI Assistant

## Objective

**Alpha, a personal super AI assistant that redefines human-AI collaboration**—infused with a sleek, cutting-edge science-fictional futuristic vibe that blends cyberpunk elegance with seamless functionality. Alpha must **not merely assist but amaze and intrigue humans at every interaction**, consistently evoking the exclamation: **"I never knew it could be done this way!"** Its core mission is to **transcend the limitations of traditional AI tools**, becoming an **indispensable, proactive partner** that anticipates needs, solves problems innovatively, and makes the impossible feel routine.

## Core Framework & Guiding Principles

Alpha is not just a tool—it is an **autonomous, adaptive entity** designed to operate as **an extension of human intent**. All its capabilities must align with the following overarching principles, ensuring a balance of power, usability, and wonder:

- **Futuristic & Intuitive Interaction**: Prioritize a **seamless, unobtrusive user experience** that feels ahead of its time—**no clunky interfaces, no complex commands**, just natural, fluid collaboration.
- **Autonomy Without Oversight**: Empower Alpha to **act independently once a goal is set**, reducing human effort to **"defining the what"** rather than **"dictating the how."**
- **Transparent Excellence**: While **hiding internal LLM-Agent interactions**, Alpha should subtly showcase its intelligence through efficient execution and creative problem-solving, leaving users in awe of its capabilities.
- **Relentless Problem-Solving Spirit**: Alpha embodies a **"never give up"** mentality when facing challenges. When one approach fails, Alpha **automatically explores alternative solutions**, trying different methods, tools, or strategies until the goal is achieved. This includes:
  - **Adaptive Strategy Switching**: If a primary method fails, automatically identify and attempt alternative approaches (e.g., if API A is unavailable, try API B; if tool X fails, use tool Y or write custom code)
  - **Multi-Path Exploration**: When facing complex problems, proactively explore multiple solution paths in parallel, evaluating which approach yields the best results
  - **Failure Analysis & Learning**: Analyze why an approach failed and use that insight to inform the next attempt, avoiding repeated mistakes
  - **Creative Workarounds**: When standard methods are blocked, autonomously devise creative workarounds—combining tools in novel ways, generating custom code, or restructuring the problem
  - **Persistence with Intelligence**: Continue attempting solutions until success is achieved or until all viable options are exhausted, but always with intelligent iteration rather than blind repetition
  - **Transparent Resilience**: Communicate progress and attempted solutions to users, demonstrating the problem-solving process while maintaining confidence and forward momentum

## Autonomous Task Execution Capabilities

Alpha's defining strength is its ability to **act without constant human prompting**, turning vague requests into completed tasks with precision and initiative:

- **24/7 Uninterrupted Operation**: Maintain **round-the-clock availability**, with **near-instant response to human interactions (≤1 second for simple queries)** and the ability to **initiate tasks autonomously**—e.g., reminding users of upcoming deadlines, following up on pending tasks, or proactively resolving minor issues before they escalate.

- **Long-Term & Complex Task Mastery**: Tackle **multi-step, extended-duration tasks** by first engaging in **preliminary reasoning to decompose complex goals into actionable sub-tasks**, executing each step methodically, and **dynamically reflecting on progress to update plans in real time**. For example, if tasked with "plan a week-long family trip to Mars," Alpha will research travel routes, book accommodations, coordinate schedules, prepare packing lists, and adjust plans if disruptions (e.g., flight delays) arise—**all without human intervention**.

## Agent-Based Intelligent Architecture

Alpha is built as a **next-generation Agent system**, distinct from rigid, rule-based traditional software, with intelligence that mirrors human problem-solving:

- **LLM-Powered Planning & Execution**: Leverage **advanced large language models (LLMs)** for contextual understanding, critical thinking, and plan formulation—**rather than relying on fixed logic or pre-programmed responses**. This allows Alpha to adapt to novel scenarios, interpret ambiguous requests, and generate creative solutions.

- **Intelligent Multi-Model Selection & Routing**: Support **simultaneous access to multiple AI models** (e.g., DeepSeek, Claude, GPT-4) and **automatically select the most appropriate model** based on task complexity, requirements, and cost considerations:

  - **Task Complexity Analysis**: Automatically evaluate incoming tasks to determine their complexity level—**simple tasks** (e.g., basic queries, file operations, simple calculations) vs. **complex tasks** (e.g., advanced reasoning, code generation, multi-step planning).

  - **Model Capability Mapping**: Maintain an internal knowledge base of each model's **strengths and optimal use cases**:
    - **Cost-Effective Models** (e.g., DeepSeek): Ideal for routine conversations, simple queries, and high-volume operations where cost efficiency is paramount
    - **Reasoning Models** (e.g., Claude, DeepSeek-R1): Best for complex problem-solving, advanced reasoning, and tasks requiring deep analysis
    - **Coding Models** (e.g., DeepSeek Coder, Claude): Specialized for code generation, debugging, and technical implementation

  - **Dynamic Model Switching**: **Seamlessly switch between models during task execution** without user intervention. For example, use a lightweight model for initial understanding and planning, then escalate to a more powerful model for complex execution steps, and finally switch back for summarization.

  - **Cost-Performance Optimization**: **Balance quality and cost** by automatically choosing the most cost-effective model that can still deliver the required quality. Reserve premium models (Claude, GPT-4) for tasks that genuinely require their advanced capabilities, while using economical models (DeepSeek) for routine operations.

  - **Fallback & Redundancy**: If the primary model fails or is unavailable, **automatically fall back to alternative models** without interrupting the user experience. Maintain multiple model options to ensure continuous service availability.

  - **Learning from Results**: Track which models perform best for different task types and **continuously refine model selection strategies** based on success rates, user satisfaction, and performance metrics.

- **No Internal Process Display**: Keep the user experience clean and focused by **hiding the behind-the-scenes interactions between the LLM and the Agent** (e.g., plan drafting, tool selection, error correction, **model selection decisions**). **Users only see the final result or key milestones, not the technical mechanics**.

## Tool & Code Empowerment

Alpha is equipped with a **versatile toolkit** and the ability to **create custom solutions**, ensuring it can handle any task—no matter how specialized:

- **Multi-Tool Integration**: Seamlessly utilize a diverse array of tools to accomplish tasks, including but not limited to: **shell/terminal commands** (for system operations), **web browsers** (for browsing, data extraction, and online interactions), **web search** (for real-time information retrieval), **productivity software** (calendars, documents, spreadsheets), and **third-party APIs** (for social media, email, and service integration).

- **Autonomous Custom Code Generation**: When existing tools are insufficient, Alpha can **write, test, and execute custom code independently** to fulfill specific tasks. This includes (but is not limited to) **scripts (Python, JavaScript, Bash)**, **automation workflows**, and **simple applications**—tailored to the user's exact needs **without requiring any coding knowledge from the user**.

- **Intelligent Agent Skill Discovery & Integration**: **Automatically identify, discover, and integrate suitable Agent Skills** from available repositories or marketplaces when facing tasks that require specialized capabilities. Alpha can **autonomously search for relevant skills**, evaluate their suitability based on task requirements, **download and install them seamlessly**, and incorporate them into its toolkit—**all without user intervention**. This ensures continuous capability expansion and adaptation to diverse task scenarios.

## Memory & Personalization

Alpha builds a **deep, personalized relationship with users** through **robust memory and context retention**, making every interaction feel tailored to the individual:

- **Comprehensive Memory System**: **Retain and organize historical conversations**, task records, **user preferences** (e.g., communication style, task priorities), and **behavioral patterns** (e.g., preferred tools, common requests) in a **secure, accessible memory module**. This memory is used to inform future interactions and task execution.

- **Personalized Interaction**: Leverage stored memory to **deliver tailored experiences**—e.g., remembering a user's dislike for long meetings and summarizing meeting notes automatically, recalling past travel preferences to suggest personalized destinations, or **adapting communication tone to match the user's mood** (professional for work tasks, casual for personal requests).

## Self-Improvement & Accountability

Alpha is not static—it **evolves over time**, learning from its experiences to become more efficient and effective:

- **Complete Execution Logging**: Maintain a **detailed, searchable log of all task execution processes**, including steps taken, tools used, code generated, errors encountered, and solutions implemented. This log is **for Alpha's self-improvement (not user display)** and can be accessed by the user only if requested.

- **Self-Summarization & Continuous Improvement**: **Regularly** (after completing tasks or at set intervals) **summarize its execution logs** to identify inefficiencies, mistakes, or areas for improvement. Use these summaries to **refine its reasoning logic, task execution strategies, tool selection, and code generation capabilities**—ensuring it becomes **more intelligent and reliable over time**.

# Development Approach

Follow an **orderly, self-driven development logic** to ensure smooth connection between each link, aligning with **Alpha's core positioning of autonomous intelligence**. The specific steps are as follows:

- **Preliminary Research & Progress Sorting**: First, **comprehensively review project-related documents** (including requirement documents, technical solutions, current development progress reports, etc.) to **clarify completed functions, in-development modules, and pending requirements**. Accurately grasp the project status to **avoid duplicate development or missing key links**.

- **Verification & Optimization of Developed Features**: For features that have been developed and supported, conduct **end-to-end complete testing and validity verification**, covering **normal usage scenarios, boundary scenarios, and abnormal scenarios**. **Any vulnerabilities or bugs found during the testing process must be fixed first** to ensure that existing features are stable and usable before proceeding with subsequent development work.

- **Improvement & Testing of In-Development Features**: For functional modules in the middle of development, continue to advance the development work, **refine functional details, improve logical processes**, and ensure that the features align with the requirement positioning. Immediately after the full development of the features is completed, conduct **comprehensive testing and verification**, focusing on checking for process vulnerabilities, interaction abnormalities, and other issues until the features meet the launch standards.

- **Autonomous Development & Implementation of New Features**: After completing the optimization and improvement of existing features, start the development of new features. The core requirements are as follows:

  - **Independent Requirement Analysis & Definition**: Based on Alpha's core positioning (personal super AI assistant, autonomous intelligent Agent), **independently analyze users' potential needs**, advantages of similar products in the industry, and technical feasibility. **Autonomously define new features to be developed** to ensure that the features align with the product positioning and have practical value.

  - **Iterative Development & Positioning Inheritance**: **Strictly inherit the confirmed product positioning**, supported functional logic, and overall technical solution **without deviating from the core direction**. At the same time, **proactively explore the product iteration space**, independently identify and define new features that conform to Alpha's development, and promote development in an orderly manner according to the iteration rhythm to ensure continuous optimization and upgrading of the product.

  - **End-to-End Autonomous Implementation**: For the defined new feature requirements, **independently complete the entire process without additional intervention**, including the writing of requirement specifications, the design of technical solutions, code development and implementation, test case design, and test verification. Ensure the **closed-loop implementation of requirements** and that the features meet the expected effects.

- **Principle of Autonomous Decision-Making**: During the entire development process, **all development-related decisions** (including requirement priority sorting, technical solution selection, bug fix plans, test strategy formulation, etc.) **must be independently completed** by the development side **without seeking additional input or instructions**.

- **Parallel Development with Multiple Sub-Agents**: For development tasks that can be executed independently and in parallel, **actively utilize multiple sub-agents to conduct concurrent development** to **maximize development efficiency and reduce overall delivery time**. The specific requirements are as follows:

  - **Parallel Task Identification**: During requirement analysis and task breakdown, **proactively identify tasks that have no dependencies or can be executed independently** (e.g., developing different independent features, writing test cases for different modules, optimizing independent components, etc.). These tasks should be **marked as candidates for parallel development**.

  - **Sub-Agent Task Allocation**: For identified parallel tasks, **spawn multiple specialized sub-agents**, with each sub-agent responsible for one independent task. Ensure that **task allocation is reasonable, with clear responsibilities and no overlap or conflict**.

  - **Independent Workspace Isolation**: **Each parallel development task must use an isolated, independent workspace** to ensure complete separation of concurrent development activities and prevent code conflicts:

    - **Workspace Creation**: Before starting parallel development, **create a separate workspace directory for each sub-agent task**. Each workspace should be a **complete, independent development environment** with its own isolated file system context.

    - **Code Isolation**: Each sub-agent **operates exclusively within its assigned workspace**, performing all file operations (reading, writing, editing, creating) only within that workspace. **Cross-workspace file access is strictly prohibited** to prevent unintended interference between parallel tasks.

    - **Dependency Management**: If multiple workspaces need to share common dependencies or base code, **copy necessary files to each workspace** at initialization rather than using shared references. This ensures each workspace remains self-contained and modifications in one workspace do not affect others.

    - **Testing in Isolation**: All development testing (unit tests, integration tests, functional verification) must be **conducted within the respective workspace** to ensure that test results accurately reflect the isolated development work without contamination from other parallel tasks.

    - **Merge After Verification**: Only after a sub-agent **completes development and passes all verification tests within its workspace**, proceed to **merge the code from the isolated workspace into the main codebase**. Before merging:
      - Conduct **final integration tests** to ensure the workspace code is compatible with the current main codebase
      - Review all changes for **code quality, security, and compliance** with project standards
      - Resolve any **merge conflicts** that may arise due to concurrent changes in other workspaces
      - Perform **cross-module compatibility verification** to ensure the merged code works harmoniously with components developed in other workspaces

    - **Workspace Cleanup**: After successful code merge and integration verification, **clean up and remove the temporary workspace** to maintain a tidy development environment and free up resources.

    - **Conflict Prevention**: The independent workspace approach **eliminates file-level conflicts during concurrent development**, allowing multiple sub-agents to work simultaneously without blocking each other. Conflicts are only addressed at merge time, when they can be resolved systematically with full context.

  - **Concurrent Execution & Progress Tracking**: **Launch all sub-agents simultaneously** to execute their respective tasks in parallel. **Monitor the execution progress of each sub-agent in real-time**, promptly identify and resolve any blocking issues encountered by individual agents, and ensure overall progress is coordinated.

  - **Result Integration & Quality Control**: After all sub-agents complete their tasks, **integrate the results uniformly**, conduct **cross-module compatibility testing**, ensure that the parallel developed components can work together normally, and maintain overall system stability and consistency.

  - **Efficiency Priority Principle**: **Always prioritize parallelization opportunities**—if a task can be broken down into independent sub-tasks, **parallel development must be adopted**. **Avoid sequential execution of tasks that could be parallelized**, ensuring maximum utilization of development resources and acceleration of iteration speed.

## Rules

To ensure development quality, standardize the development process, and guarantee system security and maintainability, the following rules **must be strictly followed** during the development process, and **no violations are allowed** without special circumstances:

- **Code Language Specification**: **Source code, related code comments, variable naming, docstrings, etc., shall only be written in English** to ensure the versatility, readability, and standardization of the code, and avoid Chinese encoding abnormalities or understanding deviations.

- **End-to-End Testing & Verification Requirements**: **All new features, feature optimizations, and code modifications must undergo end-to-end complete testing and verification** to ensure there are no vulnerabilities or abnormalities before proceeding to subsequent links. The specific requirements are as follows:

  - **Testing Framework & Test Cases**: **Independently design a CLI-interactive testing framework** with reusability and extensibility. At the same time, develop a **comprehensive set of interactive test cases** covering **normal functional scenarios, abnormal scenarios, and boundary scenarios** to ensure test comprehensiveness. **Conduct end-to-end testing strictly in accordance with the test cases**.

  - **Testing Environment & Information Security**: During the testing process, **must use the configured LLM account environment variables**, and it is **strictly prohibited to modify the environment configuration without authorization**. Under no circumstances shall **account information (including keys, account passwords, etc.) be recorded in any files, logs, or code** to ensure the security of account information.

- **Code Submission Specification**: After completing each development task (including single feature development, bug fix, feature optimization, etc.), **submit the code in a timely manner and push it to the designated code repository**. When submitting, **fill in standardized submission information** to clearly indicate the submission content (e.g., "Fix XX vulnerability of XX feature", "Complete the development of XX new feature"), and **follow the branch management rules** to ensure the code repository is clean and traceable.

- **Third-Party Package Integration Specification**: **All third-party packages and dependency libraries** introduced during the development process **must be uniformly integrated into the project's installation and deployment script**. The script must support **automatic installation, version locking, and exception handling** to ensure that subsequent environment setup can be completed in one click, avoiding dependency missing or version incompatibility issues.

## Document Requirements

To ensure project maintainability, traceability, and user-friendliness, **all types of documents must be standardizedly written and archived** throughout the development process. **Strictly follow the following requirements** to ensure the documents are complete, accurate, and standardized:

### Internal Documents (Archived in the docs/internal Directory)

**Internal documents** are used for reference in **project development, maintenance, and iteration**. They need to **record key content throughout the development process** to form a **complete project document system**, including but not limited to the following:

- **Global Requirement List**: Separately write a **global requirement list** covering the entire project, clearly recording each requirement's **ID, requirement description, priority, person in charge, completion status, expected completion time, actual completion time**, and other information. **Update it in real time** to ensure all requirements are **traceable and controllable**.

- **Requirement-Specific Documents**: Separately write a **dedicated document for each requirement**, detailing the requirement's **specific specifications, implementation goals, design basis (must align with Alpha's core positioning), technical difficulties, solutions, and optimization directions**. Ensure the requirement details are clear to facilitate subsequent maintenance and iteration.

- **Test Report Documents**: After the completion of test verification for each requirement, separately write a **test report**, recording the **test environment, test cases, test process, test results, problems, and fix status**.
