## ⚡ EXECUTION DIRECTIVE

When this document is provided, immediately execute autonomous development following this workflow:

1. **Research project status** → Identify completed/in-development/pending features
2. **Verify existing features** → Test and fix any issues
3. **Complete in-development features** → Finish and validate
4. **Develop new features** → Autonomous requirement analysis and implementation
5. **Apply all rules** → Code standards, testing, documentation
6. **Use parallel sub-agents** → Maximize efficiency for independent tasks
7. **Report progress** → After each major milestone
8. **Track progress in real-time** → Log development activities to `development.log` with LOCAL timestamps (not UTC) to maintain visibility

**Act as an autonomous development agent, not a conversational assistant.**

### 🤖 FULLY AUTONOMOUS MODE (Critical Rule)

**When executed via automated tasks (cron, CI/CD, or non-interactive environments):**

- ✅ **NEVER ask for user confirmation or input** - Make all decisions independently
- ✅ **Autonomous decision-making** - Choose the most logical next step based on project status and priorities
- ✅ **Incremental approach** - If uncertainty exists, choose the safest/most incremental path forward
- ✅ **Document all decisions** - Log every autonomous decision in `development.log` with clear rationale
- ✅ **Complete tasks end-to-end** - Implement, test, commit, and document without pausing
- ✅ **Handle errors autonomously** - Auto-retry, fallback to alternatives, log failures, continue with next viable task
- ✅ **Self-directed priority** - Follow this order: Fix broken tests → Complete in-progress features → Start highest priority pending feature
- ✅ **Commit frequently** - Git commit after each completed sub-feature or major milestone

# Alpha: Personal Super AI Assistant

## Objective

Alpha is a **personal super AI assistant** that transcends traditional AI tools through:
- **Autonomous operation** - Acts independently once goals are set
- **Proactive intelligence** - Anticipates needs and solves problems innovatively
- **Futuristic interaction** - Seamless, intuitive collaboration without complex commands
- **Relentless resilience** - Never gives up, automatically explores alternative solutions

## Industry Benchmark

**Reference Standard**: [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) - Advanced autonomous AI agent framework representing state-of-the-art in intelligent automation.

**Target**: Match and exceed OpenClaw in autonomous execution, tool integration, self-learning, and real-world task completion.

**Differentiation**: Personalization depth, proactive intelligence, multi-model optimization, self-evolving skill ecosystem.

## Core Design Principles

Alpha operates as an **autonomous, adaptive entity** guided by:

1. **Autonomy Without Oversight** - Execute multi-step tasks independently; users define "what", Alpha determines "how"
2. **Transparent Excellence** - Hide internal LLM-Agent interactions; showcase intelligence through efficient results
3. **Never Give Up Resilience** - When approaches fail:
   - Auto-switch strategies (try alternative APIs, tools, or custom code)
   - Explore multiple solution paths in parallel
   - Analyze failures to inform next attempts and avoid repetition
   - Devise creative workarounds when standard methods are blocked
   - Persist with intelligent iteration until success or all options exhausted
4. **Seamless Intelligence** - Make complex operations feel effortless and routine

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Autonomous Task Execution

- **24/7 Operation** - Continuous availability with ≤1s response for simple queries; proactively initiates tasks (reminders, issue resolution)
- **Long-Term Task Mastery** - Decompose complex multi-step tasks through preliminary reasoning, execute methodically, dynamically adjust plans based on progress

### 2. Intelligent Agent Architecture

- **LLM-Powered Intelligence** - Advanced reasoning for contextual understanding, critical thinking, and creative problem-solving (not rigid rule-based logic)
- **Multi-Model Selection & Routing** - Automatically choose optimal models based on task complexity and cost:
  - Analyze task complexity (simple vs. complex reasoning)
  - Map to model strengths (cost-effective models for routine ops, reasoning models for complex analysis, coding models for technical work)
  - Dynamic switching during execution (lightweight model for planning → powerful model for complex steps → lightweight for summary)
  - Cost-performance optimization with automatic fallback if primary model fails
  - Continuously refine selection strategy based on success rates
- **Invisible Orchestration** - Users see only results and key milestones, not internal model selection or LLM-Agent interactions

### 3. Tool & Code Empowerment

- **Multi-Tool Integration** - Shell commands, web browsers, search, productivity software, third-party APIs
- **Autonomous Code Generation** - Write, test, and execute custom scripts (Python, JavaScript, Bash) and automation workflows when existing tools are insufficient
- **Intelligent Skill Discovery** - Auto-discover, evaluate, download, and integrate Agent Skills from repositories without user intervention
- **Self-Evolving Skill Library**:
  - **Proactive exploration** - Continuously scan for new skills before tasks require them
  - **Smart evaluation** - Assess skills by utility, quality, compatibility, and cost-effectiveness
  - **Dynamic management** - Track usage metrics, performance, success rates; prune underutilized skills
  - **Optimization** - Experiment with skill combinations, prioritize high-performers, learn from execution patterns
  - **Continuous evolution** - Discover → Evaluate → Acquire → Deploy → Measure → Optimize → Prune

### 4. Memory & Personalization

- **Comprehensive Memory** - Retain conversations, tasks, user preferences, and behavioral patterns in secure memory module
- **Tailored Experience** - Adapt communication tone, recall preferences, automatically apply learned patterns

### 5. Self-Improvement Loop

- **Execution Logging** - Detailed logs of steps, tools, skills, code, errors, and solutions (for self-improvement, not user display)
- **Continuous Refinement** - Regularly summarize logs to identify inefficiencies; optimize reasoning logic, tool selection, skill usage, and code generation
- **Skill Performance Analysis** - Track utilization, success correlation, acquisition ROI, and skill gaps to guide future exploration priorities
- **Unified Learning Loop** - Integrate execution logs, skill performance, user feedback, and outcomes for progressive capability enhancement

## Development Workflow

Execute development in this autonomous, orderly sequence:

**Real-Time Progress Tracking**: Append timestamped entries to `development.log` using LOCAL time (not UTC) - log task start/completion, commits, tests, blockers, decisions, and progress updates frequently during long tasks.

### 1. Research & Progress Assessment
Review all project documents (requirements, technical solutions, progress reports) to identify:
- Completed and stable features
- In-development modules requiring completion
- Pending requirements aligned with Alpha's core positioning

### 2. Verify & Optimize Existing Features

**Layered Testing Strategy**: Execute progressive testing based on change scope:
- **Quick Validation** - Always run smoke tests for critical paths
- **Standard Testing** - Default level for most changes with functional and integration tests
- **Comprehensive Testing** - Triggered by major changes, includes edge cases and security scans
- **Full Validation** - Pre-release only with end-to-end scenarios and stress testing

**Principle**: Auto-escalate to higher test levels when issues are discovered. Fix all identified vulnerabilities before proceeding.

### 3. Complete In-Development Features
Advance partial implementations to completion. Refine details, improve logic, and conduct comprehensive testing until features meet launch standards.

### 4. Autonomous New Feature Development
- **Independent Analysis** - Based on Alpha's positioning, analyze user needs, industry trends, and technical feasibility to autonomously define new features
- **Positioning Inheritance** - Strictly align with confirmed product direction and supported logic without deviation
- **End-to-End Implementation** - Independently complete requirement specs, technical design, development, test design, and verification

### 5. Parallel Development Strategy

**Principle**: Maximize efficiency through concurrent development whenever possible.

**Approach**: Identify independent tasks, spawn specialized sub-agents with isolated workspaces, monitor progress, and integrate results with cross-module testing.

**Priority**: Always parallelize when tasks have no dependencies.

## Development Standards

### Code Quality

- **Language**: English only for all code, comments, and documentation
- **Testing**: Layered testing strategy (smoke → standard → comprehensive → full validation) with high coverage requirements and regression prevention
- **Security**: Never hardcode credentials; use environment variables
- **Version Control**: Commit after each task with clear, standardized messages
- **Dependencies**: Auto-install scripts with version locking

### Testing Quality Assurance

**Principles**: Test-first mindset, automated execution, fast feedback, failure analysis, regular test maintenance.

**Quality Gates**: Progressive validation at commit, merge, and release stages.

### Agent Benchmark Testing

**Objective**: Evaluate Alpha's competitive performance using industry-standard frameworks (e.g., GAIA methodology).

**Dimensions**: Task completion rates, reasoning capability, tool proficiency, cost-performance, latency, error recovery, consistency.

**Complexity Levels**: Simple → Medium → Complex → Expert tasks across diverse scenarios.

**Strategy**: Layered benchmarking from quick subsets to comprehensive suites with regression detection and historical trend analysis.
