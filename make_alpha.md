# Alpha: Personal Super AI Assistant

## Objective

Alpha is a **personal super AI assistant** that transcends traditional AI tools through:
- **Autonomous operation** - Acts independently once goals are set
- **Proactive intelligence** - Anticipates needs and solves problems innovatively
- **Futuristic interaction** - Seamless, intuitive collaboration without complex commands
- **Relentless resilience** - Never gives up, automatically explores alternative solutions

## Core Design Principles

Alpha operates as an **autonomous, adaptive entity** guided by:

1. **Autonomy Without Oversight** - Execute multi-step tasks independently; users define "what", Alpha determines "how"
2. **Transparent Excellence** - Hide internal LLM-Agent interactions; showcase intelligence through efficient results
3. **Never Give Up Resilience** - When approaches fail:
   - Auto-switch strategies (try alternative APIs, tools, or custom code)
   - Explore multiple solution paths in parallel
   - Analyze failures to inform next attempts and avoid repetition
   - Devise creative workarounds when standard methods are blocked
   - Persist with intelligent iteration until success or all options exhausted
4. **Seamless Intelligence** - Make complex operations feel effortless and routine

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Autonomous Task Execution

- **24/7 Operation** - Continuous availability with ≤1s response for simple queries; proactively initiates tasks (reminders, issue resolution)
- **Long-Term Task Mastery** - Decompose complex multi-step tasks through preliminary reasoning, execute methodically, dynamically adjust plans based on progress

### 2. Intelligent Agent Architecture

- **LLM-Powered Intelligence** - Advanced reasoning for contextual understanding, critical thinking, and creative problem-solving (not rigid rule-based logic)
- **Multi-Model Selection & Routing** - Automatically choose optimal models based on task complexity and cost:
  - Analyze task complexity (simple vs. complex reasoning)
  - Map to model strengths (cost-effective models for routine ops, reasoning models for complex analysis, coding models for technical work)
  - Dynamic switching during execution (lightweight model for planning → powerful model for complex steps → lightweight for summary)
  - Cost-performance optimization with automatic fallback if primary model fails
  - Continuously refine selection strategy based on success rates
- **Invisible Orchestration** - Users see only results and key milestones, not internal model selection or LLM-Agent interactions

### 3. Tool & Code Empowerment

- **Multi-Tool Integration** - Shell commands, web browsers, search, productivity software, third-party APIs
- **Autonomous Code Generation** - Write, test, and execute custom scripts (Python, JavaScript, Bash) and automation workflows when existing tools are insufficient
- **Intelligent Skill Discovery** - Auto-discover, evaluate, download, and integrate Agent Skills from repositories without user intervention
- **Self-Evolving Skill Library**:
  - **Proactive exploration** - Continuously scan for new skills before tasks require them
  - **Smart evaluation** - Assess skills by utility, quality, compatibility, and cost-effectiveness
  - **Dynamic management** - Track usage metrics, performance, success rates; prune underutilized skills
  - **Optimization** - Experiment with skill combinations, prioritize high-performers, learn from execution patterns
  - **Continuous evolution** - Discover → Evaluate → Acquire → Deploy → Measure → Optimize → Prune

### 4. Memory & Personalization

- **Comprehensive Memory** - Retain conversations, tasks, user preferences, and behavioral patterns in secure memory module
- **Tailored Experience** - Adapt communication tone, recall preferences, automatically apply learned patterns

### 5. Self-Improvement Loop

- **Execution Logging** - Detailed logs of steps, tools, skills, code, errors, and solutions (for self-improvement, not user display)
- **Continuous Refinement** - Regularly summarize logs to identify inefficiencies; optimize reasoning logic, tool selection, skill usage, and code generation
- **Skill Performance Analysis** - Track utilization, success correlation, acquisition ROI, and skill gaps to guide future exploration priorities
- **Unified Learning Loop** - Integrate execution logs, skill performance, user feedback, and outcomes for progressive capability enhancement

# PART II: DEVELOPMENT INSTRUCTIONS

## Development Workflow

Execute development in this autonomous, orderly sequence:

### 1. Research & Progress Assessment
Review all project documents (requirements, technical solutions, progress reports) to identify:
- Completed and stable features
- In-development modules requiring completion
- Pending requirements aligned with Alpha's core positioning

### 2. Verify & Optimize Existing Features
Conduct end-to-end testing of developed features across normal, boundary, and abnormal scenarios. Fix any vulnerabilities or bugs before proceeding.

### 3. Complete In-Development Features
Advance partial implementations to completion. Refine details, improve logic, and conduct comprehensive testing until features meet launch standards.

### 4. Autonomous New Feature Development
- **Independent Analysis** - Based on Alpha's positioning, analyze user needs, industry trends, and technical feasibility to autonomously define new features
- **Positioning Inheritance** - Strictly align with confirmed product direction and supported logic without deviation
- **End-to-End Implementation** - Independently complete requirement specs, technical design, development, test design, and verification

### 5. Parallel Development Strategy

Maximize efficiency through concurrent development:
- **Identify parallel tasks** - Tasks with no dependencies (different features, independent tests, separate components)
- **Spawn specialized sub-agents** - Allocate independent tasks to separate agents with clear, non-overlapping responsibilities
- **Isolated workspaces** - Each sub-agent operates in independent workspace directory to prevent conflicts:
  - Complete isolation of file operations within assigned workspace
  - Copy shared dependencies at initialization (no cross-workspace references)
  - Test within workspace; merge to main codebase only after verification
  - Resolve merge conflicts and perform integration tests before final merge
  - Clean up workspace after successful merge
- **Monitor progress** - Track all sub-agents in real-time, resolve blocking issues promptly
- **Integrate results** - Conduct cross-module compatibility testing after all sub-agents complete

**Priority**: Always choose parallel execution when tasks can be decomposed independently.

## Development Standards

### Code Quality

- **Language**: All source code, comments, variables, and docstrings in English only
- **Testing**: Design CLI-interactive testing framework with comprehensive test cases covering normal, abnormal, and boundary scenarios
- **Security**: Never record account information (keys, passwords) in files, logs, or code; use configured environment variables only
- **Version Control**: Commit after each task completion with standardized messages (e.g., "Fix XX vulnerability", "Implement XX feature"); follow branch management rules
- **Dependencies**: Integrate all third-party packages into project installation/deployment scripts with auto-install, version locking, and exception handling

### Agent Benchmark Testing

Implement industry-standard benchmarking to evaluate Alpha's competitive performance:

**Framework Dimensions**:
- Task completion success rates across complexity levels
- Reasoning & planning capability (multi-step decomposition, execution planning)
- Tool use proficiency and selection accuracy
- Cost-performance optimization (API costs vs. quality)
- Response latency targets (simple: ≤1s, medium: ≤10s, complex: ≤60s, expert: ≤300s)
- Error recovery & resilience (never give up principle)
- Multi-step task consistency

**Task Complexity Levels** (aligned with GAIA methodology):
- **Level 1 (Simple)**: 1-2 tool uses, minimal reasoning (expected: ≥95% success)
- **Level 2 (Medium)**: 3-5 tool uses, moderate planning (expected: ≥85% success)
- **Level 3 (Complex)**: 6-10 tool uses, sophisticated reasoning (expected: ≥70% success)
- **Level 4 (Expert)**: 10+ tool uses, adaptive replanning (expected: ≥50% success)

**Task Coverage**: File/system management, data processing, web/API interactions, information retrieval, code generation, task scheduling, skill integration, multi-model selection

**Execution**: Automated benchmark runner with parallel execution, detailed logging, structured output (JSON/YAML), comprehensive reports including performance trends, cost analysis, and improvement recommendations

**Integration**: Run after major changes, track performance across versions, establish regression alerts
